Getting Started
---------------

1. Copy the flume-cassandra-plugin directory into flume_dir/plugins/.  There
should also be a helloworld directory there.

2. cd into flume-cassandra-plugin

3. Build by running 'ant'.  A cassandra_plugin.jar file should be created.

4. Modify flume-site.xml (you may start out by copying
flume-site.xml.template and removing the body of the file) to include:


    <configuration>
      <property>
        <name>flume.plugin.classes</name>
        <value>org.apache.cassandra.plugins.SimpleCassandraSink</value>
        <description>Comma separated list of plugin classes</description>
      </property>
    </configuration>

5. cd into the top-level flume directory (above plugins).

6. Set FLUME_CLASSPATH for all terminals which will run Flume master or node:

    export FLUME_CLASSPATH=`pwd`/plugins/flume-cassandra-plugin/cassandra_plugin.jar:`pwd`/plugins/flume-cassandra-plugin/lib/jug-asl-2.0.0.jar

You may want to just put this in your ~/.bashrc file.  If you do, make sure to start a new terminal or run:

    source ~/.bashrc

in any terminals you will use.


Usage
-----
The Cassandra sink requires four arguments for its constructor:

1. A Cassandra server hostname (String)
2. The Cassandra server port (int)
3. A keyspace (String).  For example, 'Keyspace1'.
4. A ColumnFamily (String).

When the Cassandra sink receives an event, it does the following:

1. Creates a column where the name is a type 1 UUID (timestamp based) and the
value is the event body.
2. Inserts it into row "YYYYMMDD" (the current date) in the given ColumnFamily.

As you might guess, this is primarily targets log storage right now.
